rest :name, :terminator => ...

easy way to define wrappers

generate C code from bit-struct spec?

write extension to extract and insert bit-fields, and use that instead
  of pack/unpack

variable-length embedded fields, with referenced length field

terminated arrays?

use with mmap; in general: bit struct that references a position in another string or string-like object (e.g. a Mmap).

use require 'ipaddr'?

See ideas in

  http://www.notwork.org/~gotoken/ruby/p/as-is/pack.rb

use setbyte and getbyte ?
